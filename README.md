# Myces

[Myces](https://mferrera.github.io/myces) is a collection of reference
documents that describe how to build and operate a home microbiological
laboratory from scratch.


## Purpose

These documents are written for someone starting with no experience, equipment,
or laboratory know-how and are tailored specifically to working with yeast
(hence the name). Myces is also meant to be a living document that evolves
with the competence of its author, which is presently not very high.

Doing microbiological work in a homelab has special requirements because
single celled organisms are around, on, and within us at all times. It can
be difficult to acquire the equipment and materials needed because laboratory
vendors typically do not sell to individuals, so some shortcuts and
improvisation are required. However, getting a basic homelab to a functional
state is quite cheap and easy with some basic glassware and ingredients that
can be found, in the worst case, at specialty health food stores.

Although these documents will be published publicly, they primarily serve
as a reference guide and learning vector for myself. Factual accuracy and
correctness are **not guaranteed!**
