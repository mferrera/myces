summary: How to preserve yeast colonies for long term term storage.

Consistent inputs are important for consistent outputs. In an experimental
or culinary setting it's important to continue to work with the same
species or lineage of a particular microoragnism. The best way to achieve
this is to store samples of it long-term and then regrow it from a small
culture into the quantities you need. Storing it for this purpose is
called banking.

Because we wish to store these samples for a longer term (several
weeks to a year) we must be extra cautious about sterilization. This
storage term is also time in which contaminating bacteria can grow.
Therefore a requirement for banking is a pressure cooker to properly
sterilize our prepared samples. In particular, one that can reache 15
Psi, which excludes most electric pressure cookers like Instant Pots.


### Materials

- Isolated culture you wish to bank
- Potato-Dextrose Agar (PDA) if banking yeast
- Glass test tubes (16mm+ diameter preferred)
- Inoculation  loop
- Baking tray or other easily slantable flat surface
- Pressure cooker
- Small funnel is helpful (optional)
- Mineral oil (optional)


### Preparation

First, select the number of test tubes you wish to bank. One test tube per
sample is needed, but of course it may make sense to have multiple test
tubes per specimen you wish to bank. This would allow you to extra a sample
without needing to replace your banked slant immediately.

Each test tube will need to be filled approximately half-full by volume
of PDA. Calculate how much PDA will be required and prepare the potato and
dextrose solution without agar.

When this solution is beginning to cool add the required amount of agar to
it (2% by volume) and stir to dissolve it. We do not yet wish for it to be
solidified as we'll still need to pour it into our test tubes and sterilize
it.

Now, with or without a funnel, fill each test tube to about half full with
the warm PDA. Cap the test tubes to seal them. Ideally you should have a
test tube rack to hold your tubes vertical, and this rack can fit inside of
your pressure cooker. It may also be prudent to take advantage of this
sterilization session to sterilize distilled water, mineral oil, other
flasks, etc.

Fill the pressure cooker with near-boiling water, up to the level of the
liquid within the test tubes. This means that when you place the test tubes
in the pressure cooker the level of the water within it should be about
equal with that of the PDA within the tubes. Seal the pressure cooker and
bring it to 15 Psi for at least 15 minutes. Then, release the pressure and
let the test tubes cool until they can be handled by hand.
