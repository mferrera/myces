### What is streaking

Streaking is a technique to spread culture over a substrate like agar in
specific ways in order to create isolated colonies. There are many ways to
streak culture and some are more tailored to specific goals.

The purpose of streaking is to extract yeast (or bacteria!) from a culture
of many into colonies of few. In this case the magnitude of "few" means a few
million. The idea is that we then have a better chance of isolating
purified individual species. This allows us to more easily move them from these
colonies elsewhere. Elsewhere could be further experimentation, growing, or
storing for later.


### Required materials

- Culture you're interested in
- Agar plate
- Alcohol lamp
- Inoculation loop

There are a few different substitutions for inoculation loops. In
particular sterilized tooth picks or needles can be used, the former only
once, however.


### Techniques

The basic technique is simple to state: you dip your sterilized loop into
some culture and spread it across your dish in a methodical manner. But,
there are some standard motions involved that are simply best seen. It is
best to find a video on YouTube to see how it's done as opposed to reading.

A few common techniques are full-plate, quadrant, and multi-culture.


### Colonies

After your yeast streak plates have been growing for a few days you should
see small white dots that look a bit like tiny drops of off-white paint.
You should look for ones off by themselves. We expect that a culture
growing off by itself it predominantly of the same species. You can then
take samples of these with a sterilized inoculation loop and use them as
needed.
